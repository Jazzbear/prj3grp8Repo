		\hline
		\textbf{Actors} & \textbf{Goal} & \textbf{Descriptions} \\
		\hline\\
		User, Temp. sensor. & Readout temperature & The user wishes to monitor for the correct temperature.
		User accesses the UI, and reads temperature.  \\
		\hline \\
		User & Temperature regulation & The user notices from the temperature readout,
		that the temperature is incorrect. User accesses the UI and corrects the temperature.\\
		\hline \\
		System, UPS & Promt message about powerfailure & The system experiences a power failure, and the UPS is activated. The systems promts a message via. UI the admin and user about the powerfailur, and an estimated time of the power status of the UPS is included. \\
